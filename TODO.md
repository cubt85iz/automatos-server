# TODO

- [ ] Test quadlets for ~~Nextcloud~~, ~~Plex~~, ~~Plex Meta Manager~~, ~~Syncthing~~, ~~UniFi~~ & YTSubs
- [ ] File paths for container volumes are statically defined. Symlinks can be used to point volumes to other locations, but is there a way to allow for customization?
- [ ] Verify/troubleshoot backup scripts.
