# TODO

- [ ] Implement quadlet for Immich
- [ ] Test quadlets for Nextcloud, Plex, Plex Meta Manager, Syncthing, UniFi & YTSubs
- [ ] Test EmbyServer with Intel ARC A380
- [ ] Review LoadCredential, LoadCredentialEncrypted, SetCredential, etc.
- [ ] Does Nextcloud AIO require timers for routine maintenance or indexing full text search?
- [ ] File paths for container volumes are statically defined. Symlinks can be used to point volumes to other locations, but is there a way to allow for customization?
